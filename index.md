# Welcome!

Oh hi!  Thanks for visiting our little site.   So...whats the deal?

We wanted a way to be able to give out information on CrikeyCon's CTF, prior to the con, as well as place where we might be able to put up writeups etc afterwards too.   So...here we are.

There will be various FAQ's etc, and hopefully we'll keep adding to the site, so bear (hehe...Bear...as in Droppy....get it...........WHATEVER!) with us while we keep adding content.

# FAQs
### What is a CTF?
For a great explanation check out [CTFd.io - Whats A CTF](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/).

### When is CrikeyConCTF? (2019)
CrikeyConCTF 2019 will take place at CrikeyCon 2019 on April 6th-7th 2019, in Brisbane, QLD, Australia.

### Will the CTF be playable online?
No, the CTF is only available on the CTF wireless network at CrikeyCon.### How much will it cost to play the CTF?
$25 a player........naa, course not (good idea though).  It's free!

### What skill level is CrikeyConCTF?
CrikeyConCTF has always been a "beginner" level CTF, we always have challenges for the more skilled players, and we hope to keep them entertained.  But CrikeyConCTF is aimed for people who've never played a CTF before, and beginners who are just getting started.  We want people to go away having learned something, even if it's 1 thing.

### What category of challenges will there be?
* Web
* Crypto
* Exploit
* Trivia
* GRC Trivia

### I'm a good CTF player, but before i play i want to know what the prizes will be?
Naaa, this CTF ain't for you.  We want people to have fun, and learn something.  Sure everyone loves a winner, but if thats your main focus, you won't enjoy this CTF.

Having said that, we will have prizes, donated by our awesome sponsors PenTestLabs and OzHack.
We give away prizes and trophys to the top 3 teams, but also give away random prizes throughout the CTF.  Basically we will pick a point during the game, watch the log for incoming correct flags and the next team to submit, wins the prize.  This means, ANYONE can win a prize, just by playing the CTF.

### I've NEVER played a CTF before, but keen to play, what will i need?
Awesome, this CTF is for you.  The main thing you'll need is a laptop.  The scoreboard and most of the challenges should be accessible on a mobile phone, but you may need certain tools to solve challenges you'll probably need a laptop to run.
We suggest you either run Kali Linux on your laptop, or run it in a Virtual Machine on your laptop.  It has the majority of the tools you'll need.  If you've never set this up before, come see a member of the CTF crew and we should be able to help you get setup.

If you don't have a laptop, or don't want to bring one, we do have 4 "loaner" laptops which will be setup, running Kali Linux on a USB stick.  Please use them, and once done, give them a reboot so anything you've done gets removed.

So...you have a laptop, you have Kali.  Find a seat in the CTF room (or anywhere else round the venue) and connect to the "CrikeyCTF" wireless network which should be available.  The password for the wireless network is "crikeyctf".
Once connected browse to https://ctf.crikeycon.com and you'll get to the scoreboard, register as a player, and register a team or join an existing one with friends.  Once registered and logged in, click on the "Challenges" andf start playing!

### What are the rules of playing the CTF?
Please read the rules listed here

### Is it safe to play the CTF/join the CTF network?
Well...hopefully, yes, it's safe.  But you are on a hostile network, there are other hackers on there, but hopefully everyone abides by the Rules, including not attacking other players.  We hope it doesn't happen, but idiots will be idiots sometimes.  If you do think someones doing something they shouldn't please let a member of the CTF crew immediatly so we can investigate.
